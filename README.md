# 🌐 Personal Website — **Huỳnh Hữu Nghĩa**

This is my **personal portfolio website**, where I introduce myself and showcase my projects as a *Computer Science student*.  

🔗 **Live Site:** 👉 [nghiahhh.github.io](https://nghiahhh.github.io/)

## ⚠️ **Limitations**
The website is **flexible and works on most devices**, but it is **not fully optimized** for every screen size.  
On some phones or smaller displays, **certain information may not be shown properly**.  
I am currently improving its **responsiveness** for a better user experience.  
✨ Stay tuned for the next version!
